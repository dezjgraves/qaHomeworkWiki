It will be a good test for the Bears O-Line on Saturday. 

The Bills have a good defensive front. Greg Rousseau, Ed Oliver, DaQuan Jones, Von Miller, and a familiar face Leonard Floyd.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs still a competition.‚Äù ‚Äî Bears coach Matt Eberflus on the team‚Äôs No. 2 quarterback for Saturday. 

He won‚Äôt say who it is but you can tell the team is impressed by rookie Tyson Bagent.

‚ÄúThat was created by pure competition,‚Äù Eberflus said.
